  #### Arduino library for I2C RTCs.

  This library enables the functionality for clock reading, clock setting, alarms and timers of I2C RTCs



## Real Time Clocks
* DS1307
* DS3231
* PCF8563


## Objective
* Create a simple Arduino library for I2C RTCs (Real Time Clock) which can be understand by beginners.
* Inspired by [Arduino Zero](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/RTC) RTC library
* Accessing all the features of RTCs.
* Readable code with Comments and [Documentation](../wiki/Home).
